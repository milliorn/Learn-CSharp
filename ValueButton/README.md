# Walkthrough: Inherit from a Windows Forms Control with CSharp

With C#, you can create powerful custom controls through inheritance. Through inheritance you are able to create controls that retain all of the inherent functionality of standard Windows Forms controls but also incorporate custom functionality. In this walkthrough, you will create a simple inherited control called ValueButton. This button will inherit functionality from the standard Windows Forms Button control, and will expose a custom property called ButtonValue.
