# Tutorial: Create a .NET Standard library using Visual Studio

In this tutorial, you create a simple utility library that contains a single string-handling method. You implement it as an extension method so that you can call it as if it were a member of the String class.

A class library defines types and methods that are called by an application. A
class library that targets .NET Standard 2.0 allows your library to be called by
any .NET implementation that supports that version of .NET Standard. When you
finish your class library, you can distribute it as a third-party component or
as a bundled component with one or more applications.
