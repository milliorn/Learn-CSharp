# Tutorial: Get started with Razor Pages in ASP. NET Core

This is the first tutorial of a series that teaches the basics of building an ASP. NET Core Razor Pages web app.

At the end of the series, you'll have an app that manages a database of movies.

In this tutorial, you:

    Create a Razor Pages web app.
    Run the app.
    Examine the project files.

At the end of this tutorial, you'll have a working Razor Pages web app that you'll enhance in later tutorials.
