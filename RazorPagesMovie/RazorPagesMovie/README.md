# Tutorial: Get started with Razor Pages in ASP. NET Core

## Pages folder

Contains Razor pages and supporting files. Each Razor page is a pair of files:

A .cshtml file that has HTML markup with C# code using Razor syntax.
A .cshtml.cs file that has C# code that handles page events.
Supporting files have names that begin with an underscore. For example, the _Layout.cshtml file configures UI elements common to all pages. This file sets up the navigation menu at the top of the page and the copyright notice at the bottom of the page. For more information, see Layout in ASP.NET Core.

## wwwroot folder

Contains static assets, like HTML files, JavaScript files, and CSS files. For more information, see Static files in ASP.NET Core.

## appsettings.json

Contains configuration data, like connection strings. For more information, see Configuration in ASP.NET Core.

## Program.cs

Contains the entry point for the app. For more information, see .NET Generic Host in ASP.NET Core.

## Startup.cs

Contains code that configures app behavior. For more information, see App startup in ASP.NET Core.
