# Walkthrough: Debug Custom Windows Forms Controls at Design Time

When you create a custom control, you will often find it necessary to debug its design-time behavior. This is especially true if you are authoring a custom designer for your custom control. For details, see Walkthrough: Creating a Windows Forms Control That Takes Advantage of Visual Studio Design-Time Features.

You can debug your custom controls using Visual Studio, just as you would debug any other .NET Framework classes. The difference is that you will debug a separate instance of Visual Studio that is running your custom control's code.
