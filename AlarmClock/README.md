# Walkthrough: Author a Composite Control with CSharp

Composite controls provide a means by which custom graphical interfaces can be created and reused. A composite control is essentially a component with a visual representation. As such, it might consist of one or more Windows Forms controls, components, or blocks of code that can extend functionality by validating user input, modifying display properties, or performing other tasks required by the author. Composite controls can be placed on Windows Forms in the same manner as other controls. In the first part of this walkthrough, you create a simple composite control called ctlClock. In the second part of the walkthrough, you extend the functionality of ctlClock through inheritance.
