# Walkthrough: Perform common tasks using designer actions

As you construct forms and controls for your Windows Forms application, there are many tasks you'll perform repeatedly. The following list shows some of the commonly performed tasks you'll come across:

Adding or removing a tab on a TabControl.

Docking a control to its parent.

Changing the orientation of a SplitContainer control.

To speed development, many controls offer designer actions, which are context-sensitive menus that allow you to perform common tasks like these in a single gesture at design time. These tasks are called designer actions verbs.

Designer actions remain attached to a control instance for its lifetime in the designer and are always available.
